title: "Bringing Back Ideas from our Visit of Schloss Dagstuhl"
---

The Annual Meeting of the German Research Training Groups in Computer Science at Schloss Dagstuhl offers a unique opportunity for young researchers to connect and exchange ideas - and we had the pleasure to participate in this year's encounter. 
This allowed us to present the vision of CAUSE to fellow RTGs and to share our initial steps toward enabling self-explanation in cyber-physical systems. 
Through discussions about our respective research, we identified shared interests and sparked new ideas.

The represented RTGs covered a wide range of application areas, including medicine and law - a variety also reflected in the keynotes. 
Prof. Dr. Sebastian Baltes (University Bayreuth) emphasized the complexity of measuring the effect of AI assistants, as one does not simply measure efficiency in software development. 
Prof. Dr. Felienne Hermans (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) introduced Hedy, a programming language designed to teach students in schools the basic ideas behind programming, which is a necessary first step before learning how to write a program yourself. 
An insight into advancements in humanâ€“AI synergies at the Honda Research Institute Europe was given by Prof. Dr. Heiko Wersing. 
These keynotes represented just one highlight within the diverse program of the meeting.
