I am a Research Assistant in the Software Engineering group at the University of Bremen, working under supervision of Prof. Rainer Koschke. My research is carried out within the CAUSE Research Training Group (RTG), which focuses on explaining interrelations in digitally controlled systems.

My work lies at the intersection of code summariation, program analysis, software–hardware interrelations, and explainable systems. In particular, I focus on static analysis and code summarization techniques for understanding dependencies in complex systems, with an emphasis on LLVM-based analyses, program slicing, and System Dependency Graphs (SDGs). In addition, I work on code summarization and I am broadly interested in machine learning and deep learning approaches for software engineering, especially in combination with traditional program analysis techniques. A central goal of my research is to make low-level analysis results more understandable, explainable, and actionable for developers working in interdisciplinary environments involving both software and hardware components.

Below you can find an overview of my past and current research topics, as well as areas I am interested in exploring in future collaborations. I am open to collaborating on related research and applied projects.
