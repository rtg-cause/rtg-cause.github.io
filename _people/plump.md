I am a researcher and PhD candidate at the group of computer architecture at the University of Bremen. I am an associated fellow at the CAUSE research group. My main topic of research is optimisation with meta heuristics, especially in the context of domain-application, and thus under dynamisation and surrogate models. In the past two years, I have delved into explainability, especially in the inter-system usage. Herein, I try to answer the question of how to communicate optimisation decisions to other system components to allow them to effectively adapt their usage of these decision when encountering changing environments or constraints.
