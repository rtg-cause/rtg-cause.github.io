Mohammad Alkhiyami is a doctoral researcher at Hamburg University of Technology, where he investigates how digital hardware can explain its own behaviour during runtime. As part of the CAUSE program, his work focuses on using temporal specifications and formal methods to build hardware systems that can detect unexpected behaviour and automatically provide meaningful explanations.
 
His research bridges RTL design, model checking, and runtime analysis to create hardware that is more transparent, trustworthy, and easier to debug. He is also interested in HW/SW co-explanation—understanding how self-explaining hardware interacts with software stacks and how these insights can support verification and system-level design.
